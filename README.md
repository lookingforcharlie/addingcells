# Adding Cell in between Cells

## Inspired by [Web Dev Cody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJc5cX_D1Lg&t=3s)

## Knowledge

- use slice() to insert a value into an array
- can't use splice() to insert value by set function, cos splice changes the original value of the state, React doesn't like it.
